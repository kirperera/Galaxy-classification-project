 Galaxy Classification Project
 
This is my first project in data science domain. So basically my objective of this  project is to build a machine learning pipeline for classifying galaxies into morphological categories using NASA skyview data.

## üìå Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with **image processing** and astronomical data (FITS format).  
- Enhance skills in **data science & deep learning** through an end-to-end ML project.  
- Create an **industry-ready GitHub project** demonstrating dataset acquisition, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.  

## üõ∞Ô∏è Dataset
We will use publicly available data from:
- **NASA SkyView Virtual Observatory** ([link](https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl))  
- Surveys like **DSS**, **2MASS**, or **SDSS** depending on coverage and quality.  

The pipeline will automatically download images of galaxies and prepare them for training.
